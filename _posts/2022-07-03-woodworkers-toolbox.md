title:  "A Woodworker's Toolbox"
---

For those who know me, I tend to make a steady stream of toolboxes, at least one a quarter.  There's something soothing about giving tools a working home for me.  In fact, if a need arises, I'll often drop whatever other projects I'm working on to make a toolbox.  I've also bought my share of ones I've come across both in-person, and online.

Traditional toolboxes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.  I've bought at least five different books on toolboxes, and filling them, and I have a fascination with dedicated fixtures for storing tools within them.  My "shop" is small, it's just one side of 10x8 laundry room that also has a utility sink, the water heater, the indoor unit of our AC, and my workbench.  Because of this, I've mostly focused on medium and small size toolboxes, ranging from something to hold a Stanley 59 doweling jig up to a small Dutch Tool Chest.  I've experimented with a few options in-between.

The first box I ever made was actually not a toolbox at all, it was a simple box to hold 1-pound black powder cans.  It was pine, made with only a super cheap home-center saw with impulse hardened teeth and a few nails.  I remember knocking out the waste with a hammer for the enormous box joint, and being careful to only put nails into the sides and not the ends so it could blow apart and not blow up if it ever caught on fire.  It was on that project that I learned a 1x4 wasn't actually 4 inches wide.  Next, I purchased a range box from an actual woodworker and it was amazing!  Iron hinges, hasp, and top-handle with a removable tray.  It was perfect for what I needed, and will be a lifelong treasure.

Fast forward another six years from those times and I started watching some YouTube videos on woodworking.  I started buying vintage tools, and of course, those tools needed a place to live.  I started with a tool wall, but quickly outgrew it.  My first actual toolbox was the Dutch Tool Chest, followed by a cabinet underneath.  I've experimented a few times since with the Dutch Tool Chest, making half-size, and quarter-size versions.

In addition to the Dutch Tool Chests, I've also made a tool wall with plane and saw tills, a Japanese style toolbox, two boxes to hold a Stanley 45, a pair of Gentlemen's Tool Chests, and most recently I'm in the process of making a tool tote.  I plan on trying out Tom Fidgen's tool chest next, too.  Most of these have been given away as I try something new.  What I've learned from all this is that while the H. O. Studley toolbox was an amazing invention, absolutely gorgeous, and I'd give one of every extra organ I have to own it, a box that has a place for everything and nothing more is really not for me.  I really need the ability to expand and shift things up.

If you're just starting out, the Gentleman's Tool Chest is awesome, and can be made in a day with nails and straight cuts.  Leave yourself 18 inches of length to fit a backsaw, about 9 inches of width, and at least 7 inches of height.  A gentleman's Tool Chest can hold a LOT!  Soon you'll want to upgrade to something like a Dutch Tool Chest.  If you want a portable one, I recommend going less wide than the standard plans if you can, around 20 inches in overall width and 20 inches in height.  Finally, there's the big honkin' English toolchest such as the one described in Christopher Schwarz's Anarchist's Tool Chest.  One day I'll build one of these behemoths, but not until I get a new house and bigger shop.

What follows are some of the various toolboxes I've made along the way.

### The Powder Box

My powder box, designed to hold 10 one-pound black powder cans.

### The Range Box

I purchased this box to carry to the range with my muzzleloading rifle and pistol.  I love it!

### Japanese Tool Box

The first toolbox I made for someone else, the Japanese Toolbox is cavernous and will hold a lot!

### Gerstner Tool Chest

Not really idea for woodworking, this was a Gerstner I bought and re-did the felt.  In fact, the hide glue is still wet in the picture as you can see on some of the corners.  This is a 7-drawer model from the 40s.

My Dutch Tool Chest and lower cart holds a LOT of tools.

### Box for a Stanley 45

I made this to ship a Stanley 45, but it has ample room for the cutters and extras.

### Display Case for a Stanley 45

This display case was for another Stanley 45 I have.  I like how everything has a special place.

### Doweling Jig

I had a Stanley 59 jig in a half-broken styrofoam box, so it got an upgrade.

### Gentleman's Tool Chest

This turned into a giveaway in the Vintage Tool Patch last year, but this simple chest held an impressive amount of tools!  Everything needed to support a fun hand tool woodworking hobby.

### Another Gentleman's Tool Chest

I made this chest for a friend who wanted to start making canoe paddles with hand tools.

### Stanley 903

One of the most fun projects I've done!  It took almost 2 years to locate all the tools that go inside.

### Half Dutch Tool Chest

I made this chest to give to my father.  It was filled with all sorts of tools with special meaning.

### Quarter Dutch Tool Chest

I made this in a shop project exchange.  It's only about 12 inches wide, 18 inches tall, and 7 inches deep inside.  Viking hinges on top and no hasp.
