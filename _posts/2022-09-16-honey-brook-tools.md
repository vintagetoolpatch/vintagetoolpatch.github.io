I’m Will Adams and I’m the sole proprietor of [Honey Brook Tools and Woodworks][1] based in Barre, Vermont, USA. I started my work as a full-time tool maker in March of this year after resigning my job as an elementary school teacher in January of 2022.

I practice a hybrid woodworking approach to my toolmaking with my wood lathe being the primary machine used in my work flow. Beyond that, the majority of my work is with hand tools. I offer marking knives, dovetail marking knives, awls, winding sticks, marking gauges, split-nut screwdrivers, sliding bevel gauges, wooden try squares, and small bench or carver’s mallets.

I appreciate and draw inspiration from simple, classic designs. I have a variety of vintage turnscrews and have always been struck by how the handle designs feel good in the hand and are also aesthetically pleasing. For me it’s important that the tools we use not only be highly functional but also be aesthetically pleasing and inspirational. As artisans that’s what we do, we combine function and aesthetic appeal. Having hand tools that work flawlessly, feel good in the hand, and are aesthetically pleasing and inspirational is a great starting point for great work.

All of my tools are unconditionally guaranteed to live up to these ideals. If they don’t, you can simply return them at my expense for a replacement or full refund.

I’m eager to get to know folks here in the Vintage Tool Patch and hope you will appreciate and bid on my offerings!
