title:  "Goodbye Phil Gaynor"
---

Last weekend we learned that Phil Gaynor passed away. Known in the online woodworking world as "An Irish Woodworkers Diary" Phil began to get involved in the Vintage Tool Patch this year. In the short time he spent with us on the Vintage Tool Patch he made a huge impact. From his challenges to projects, to the never ending stream of encouraging comments. Phil's sheer enthusiasm and love of the craft lifted up any conversation he joined. Many of us have benefited from Phil's company. Phil had shared several pieces he wrote for woodworking magazines through the years to use for diversion posts on Sunday. The last of these had not yet been used, and follows below. As it was written in 2018, I reached out to Peter Tiffney who knew Phil a lot better than me, to see if there is anything he would like to add from more recent years. What Peter sent was so lovely I've added it after in its entirety. Goodbye Phil. You will be missed.

*Through The Ages*
August 2018

I was 7 years of age, this was back in 1978, a young boy awaiting for his uncle paddy Gillespie to arrive to fit the new front door to our home. The man, my uncle, arrived in a silver Ford Capri with a black vinyl roof in which he takes from the back of the car a very well and heavily used pair of saw horses a tool box and two hand sawâ€™s.

I remember this as if it were only yesterday. Anyway, I stood watching the man work on changing the front door and to say the only power tool my uncle had was a Bosch jigsaw which he used to cut out the letter box. To say I was amazed at what this man done that day with only a few hand tools; from that day on my goal in life was to become a Carpenter.

Ten years later 1988 at 17 years of age my uncle took me on and I started my journey. Although only for a few months, I learned so much, most of which was to respect your tool and ask lots of questions.

Later that same year I started working for a Mr Tom Croffey a Galway man who taught me the rest of my trade. Everything from roofing to shop fitting and everything else in-between. I stayed working for Tom till about 1992 ish.

By 1998 I was 27 years of age and like most young men of that age I knew it all I was ready to conquer the world. OMG I was so not ready. The world is a much different place and at that stage of my life I had a house and children and a car and van and was in and out of work like a yoyo. Mostly working on new builds and an odd renovation this was a hard time in my life working hard and feeling I was going nowhere.

Itâ€™s now 2008 I was 37 years old and falling out of love with my job my trade and my skills. Iâ€™ve just lost all interest. I was at my workshop one morning when I met a man who was moved into a workshop beside me I think it was 2010.

Yes;  the years well all the years
Where have they gone?

Anyway I met John Hatton and after a few weeks of knowing him he told me about a college course he was doing and that I should think about going back to college myself. It was a furniture making course in which I enrolled for two years. And made a tall case clock and a chair along with several other bits and pieces. In 2011 I got student of the year and won a prize which I am so proud of.  At this point I must say my wife was and is my rock and without her support none of this was possible . And by 2012 I was back in work after a very long recession.

Well its 2018 now, Iâ€™m 47 years of age and as I sit here writing my story and I think of all the people I met on my journey through the years. Way too many to mention but if thereâ€™s two people I should be ever grateful to; well thatâ€™s my uncle Paddy Gillespie for giving me my first glimpse into woodworking and the other man, Mr Tom Croffey for being patient with me  and teaching me all he knew. In his own words do the job right and speed will follow in time.

And so at 47 years of age I am very proud to report that I am that young boy from 1978 that boy who fell in love with woodworking all those years ago. I might not be as famous as David Charlesworth, David Barron or Paul Sellers or even Norm Abram, but I am as passionate about woodworking as all the above mentioned and thanks to youtube these men share their skills with us. Today I love my job my trade and some day I will share my skills to the world of Youtube 
Thank you for reading my letter 

Kind regards 

Phil Gaynor 

From Peter Tiffney:

Phil and I met through his YouTube channel were he was showing his hand tool skills over the weeks and months we became very good friends exchanged, ideas thoughts and helped each other on our project.

I really hit it off with Phil. I sent him tools over the years. In lots of his youtube videos you will hear Phil say "my good friend Peter Tiffney". There was nothing we couldn't talk about. One day I am in the house and a bloody huge parcel arrives. It's only a whisky cabinet Phil made for me. The bugger was sending pictures and asking questions on this and that, all along he knew it was for me. I was clueless. The shock to receive such a fine piece of work. Wow such a talented cabinet maker. 

As we continued our passion we would discuss about all the tools we had. I told him about my saw sharpening and how I teach for free. Next thing there's this stunning saw vice with a letter. Here Peter, try this out, its a gift for you. Be honest with me if it's any good. Well I used it for 3 months and couldn't fault it. Perfect saw vice. I am so proud to have 2 pieces of Phils work. Phil was so passionate about his hand tools, his skills and his knowledge of them was evident in his work . I know Phil wants us all to continue our love of hand tool woodworking.

We were going to meet up at Carlton Scroop next year. I'm going to miss you Phil, more than just a friend ðŸ˜¢ rest in peace Phil, your tools will follow shortly . Peter.

And Phil left us with one last build challenge, the bench top tool box.

The saw vice he gifted to Peter Tiffney. I'm lucky enough to have one too. It transformed saw sharpening from drudgery to delight for me.

I was lucky enough to visit Phil at home in November. The whiskey cabinet here is absolutely mind blowing. No photo can do it justice.  One of these days I intend to copy it, but I honestly don't feel my skills are quite up to it at this point.
