title:  "Rounding Planes"

If you do not have a lathe, and want to make long dowels, the rounding plane is your solution. The rounding plane has a round, usually tapered channel running through its center. Stock is inserted into the larger end of the channel and the rounding plane is rotated around it, taking shavings like a large pencil shaver.

To use it, its best not to have the stock too much over size, if its too big it simply wont fit in the mouth of the plane, and the closer the stock is to the final dimensions, the less work it will be to turn by hand. Use a jack plane to bring the stock down to a rough octagon before feeding it in.

The Iron in these planes is usually presented at an angle (again like a giant pencil sharpener, as the stock moves further into the plane its gradually reduced to the final size, and a deep cut does not need to be taken at any point, reducing the chances of tear-out.

There are 3 common variations of the Rounding Plane.

1. The Stail Engine/Witchet

Stail engines (or Witchets in the US) are adjustable rounding planes. They are commonly used to create long tapered pieces, such as broom handles, snooker cues, fishing rods, etc. Commonly used with the work piece turning in a lathe, but they can be used purely by hand. The screws on the Stail Engine are tightened as you work along the piece to create the taper. They can be used as a simple adjustable rounding plane, but my own experience is that this results in a bit of variation in width, due to play in the tool.

2. Trapping Planes

Similar to the Stail engine, and almost exclusively used with a lathe or turning device. By applying and releasing tension trapping planes allow tapers and swells to be created along a work piece.

3. The Tapered Tenon cutter

Tapered tenon cutters create conical tapers at the end of a work piece. These are used in chair making and staked furniture. A tapered tenon becomes tighter over time if force is applied against it, and has little chance of pushing through mortise over time like a round tenon will. Veritas sell a tapered tenon cutter and a dowel rounder (really a small rounding plane). The only difference between the two is the shape of the iron.

Finally a useful accessory tool for rounding planes and tenon cutters. A spoke pointer allows you to quickly taper the end of the stock. This makes is easy to start the stock in the rounding plane, and to center it for tapered tenon cutters.

A vintage rounding plane. As you might guess, its not that difficult to make your own.

Veritas dowel & tapered tenon cutters. A little less comfortable to turn by hand than a traditional rounding plane. They are designed to be clamped down and have the stock fed into them.

Ashem crafts rounding planes. Fully adjustable using spokeshave like components. Ashem sadly are no longer in business. Note the trapping plane at the bottom. By applying/releasing pressure with the lever you can shape a piece as you move along it.
