title:  "Wooton's Patent Cabinet Office Secretary"
---

This week I'm going to share what I consider an iconic piece of furniture. We all have pieces that capture our imagination. I think Chris Byrne first showed me some images of the Wooton's Patent Cabinet Office Secretary. I was captivated, and remain so.

These desks date back to the late 1800s. The patented design was issued to William S. Wooton, a former pattern maker who had turned to making school and office furniture. As the size of business grew, this was Wootens solution for the busy executive with a lot to keep track of. 

You can view the original patent here: [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ad/b2/96/c6b8acb26e241d/US155604.pdf](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ad/b2/96/c6b8acb26e241d/US155604.pdf), which while cool, is nowhere near as attractive as the manufactured desks.

The desks where produced in a variety of grades and patterns. The most basic and least ornamented sold for $100, roughly $3000 in todays money. The finest $750, around $22500 today.

The desk featured a lot of truly cool features. It locked, the sides swung out and the desk down. When not in use it was compact and secure. A letter box on the outside allowed the office mail boy (the predecessor to the internet) to drop off post. The entire desk could be moved easily on casters. Depending on the model, over 100 compartments gave a place for everything.

If you would like to dive down the Wooton rabbit hole.

This is the kind of project I'd like to a crack at building someday. But I think my skills and free time mean its bookmarked as a possible retirement project!
