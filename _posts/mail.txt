Union Manufacturing Company has signed with a new foundry based in Lebanon, Pennsylvania to cast the Union X No. 0A and X No. 0 as wall as the various "SP" 0 sized models.

The new foundry will be pouring all X0 series components to ensure they are of the highest possible quality and meet our VERY strict standards.

Union'sBoard of Directors unanimously approved the relationship and financial commitments to ensure

The new foundry was toured and vetted by three of Union's Board members 9 months ago. All walked away impressed with the foundry's quality control and standards. Negotiations were completed with favorable results at the end of last week. The new foundry will be able to produce both the Limited serialized X0A and the X0 back to back. The state of the art practices of the foundry make us cautiously optimistic that more good news will follow soon.

Our existing foundry will be conducting a test pour of the X No. 4-1/4 tommorrow. The process for pouring the 4-1/4 has been completely revised and now using technology that will be a world first for hand plane production.

Union was resurrected SPECIFICALLY to bring the XPlane back to life, and the hand planes have been our core focus since day one. We are 100% commited to not only make these great planes, but also to make the best possible plane for you, the user. We look forward to ressurecting this great design while respecting the historical poast of one of hte most influential tool companies in the world.

Sincerely,

Robert Porter
President, Union Manufacturing Company
